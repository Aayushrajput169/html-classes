    <h1>What is Core Web Vitals</h1>
    <p>Core Web Vitals are a set of three metrics that measure the speed, interactivity, and visual stability of a webpage. They are considered to be important ranking factors for search engine optimization (SEO), and improving them can help your website rank higher in search results and provide a better user experience.</p>
    <h3>there are three Core Web Vitals</h3>

    <p><h3>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</h3> This measures how long it takes for the largest content element on a page to load. LCP should be less than 2.5 seconds in order to provide a good user experience.

        <h3> Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):<h3> This measures how much a page’s layout shifts unexpectedly as it loads. CLS should be less than 0.1 for a good user experience.
        
            <h3>First Input Delay (FID):<h3> This measures how long it takes for the browser to respond to a user’s first interaction with a page, such as a click or a tap. FID should be less than 100 milliseconds for a good user experience.</p>
